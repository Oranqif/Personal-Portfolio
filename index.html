                                Hello, I am <b>Muhammad Thaqif Mikail Bin Jumat</b>.<br>
                                <br>
                                I would consider myself a developer at heart as<br>
                                I have a passion in programming and coding.<br>
                                I know coding languages such as C#, JavaScript<br>
                                and Python.<br>
                                <br>
                                I am currently learning about developing<br>
                                application for mobile and I am excited for the<br>
                                day when I will be able to put my knowledge and<br>
                                skill to the test.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div id="about-section-2">
                        <p class="about-text">Before I enrolled in Republic Polytechnic, I was a person who took
                            interest in coding.
                            It came from watching YouTube videos ranging from programming in video games to website
                            designs.
                            Ever since then, I am hoping to further my studies into Computer Science.
                            Not only would it be something I like to do but it also helps me get into companies that
                            specialize in technology regarding computers.<br>
                            <br>
                            Other than being a developer, I also like to do designs too.
                            I thought that it is neat that I am able to express my creativity and transfer my
                            imagination in my brain to my work in the real world.
                            Although, I treat it more of a hobby than an actual skill. All of my designs were inspired
                            by other designers' works.<br>
                            <br>
                            Enough about my skills and knowledge, what about me personally?
                            I tend to usually be introverted but I can get along with anybody especially in a team
                            setting.
                            One of my hobbies is playing all different types of video games from survival to RPG.
                            When I get motivated, I can really focus on what is important to me.
                            I don't have a favorite food because it is hard to pick one as they all bring different
                            flavors and experiences to the table.
